# Overview
A website created step-by-step by following Harry Percival's [Obey The Testing Goat Book](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/pages/book.html)

Here are my versions of the sites.  They are a work in progress.  Please navigate to the sites and revel in the fact that they are 100% tested through the TDD method!  I'm using Digital Ocean to deploy them.
* `staging: ` [staging.obeymyowntestinggoat.website](http://www.staging.obeymyowntestinggoat.website)
* `production: ` [obeymyowntestinggoat.website](http://www.obeymyowntestinggoat.website)  

# Currently Working On: Chapter 22
* Skipped deploying Jenkins server in chapter 21 due to Jenkins difficulties
* But did create mechanism to run Selenium headless with xfvb and implemented screenshot_taking mechanism on error
