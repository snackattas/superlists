# Overview
A website created step-by-step by following Harry Percival's [Obey The Testing Goat Book](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/pages/book.html)

Here are my versions of the sites.  They are a work in progress.  Please navigate to the sites and revel in the fact that they are 100% tested through the TDD method!  I'm using Digital Ocean to deploy them.
